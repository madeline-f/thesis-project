# Hello! This thesis project is through the Master of Science in Social Data Science program at the University of Copenahagen
# The NewsCatcher API (https://newscatcherapi.com/) is utilized to collect data
# The research question is: What patterns of language use and framing are present in media coverage of male versus female Fortune 500 CEOs, 
# and how do these patterns reflect potential gender bias in media portrayal?
# On a deeper level, there are a couple topics that can be explored through analysis:
# Language and Tone: Are there notable differences in the adjectives, verbs, or overall tone used in articles of male vs. female CEOs?
# Focus and Framing: What aspects of each CEOâ€™s career or personal life are emphasized in the articles?
